# deep-space.vim
A dark, intergalactically friendly Vim color scheme, based off of [hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid), and my [Deep Space](https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/deep-space-syntax) syntax theme for [Atom](https://atom.io).

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyrannicaltoucan/vim-deep-space/master/images/screenshot.png)

To be able to use this theme you will need one of the following (for now):
* NeoVim with true-color support.
* Vim 7.4.1799 with `termguicolors` enabled.

In combination with the above, a 24-bit ('true-color') terminal emulator will be needed. You can find a list of compatible terminals [here](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728).

Any GUI version of Vim will also work.

## Installation
There are a couple of ways to install this color scheme:
* Via a package manager (such as [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), etc.)
* Download this colorscheme to `~/.vim/colors/`

Then simply add `colorscheme deep-space` to your `.vimrc` file. You can also test this color scheme beforehand by entering `:colorscheme deep-space` in Vim.

## TODO
- [ ] Provide 16 and 256-color support.
- [ ] Support for various plugins.
- [ ] Options for enabling/disabling italic and bold fonts.
- [ ] Better language support.
