# deep-space.vim
A dark color scheme based off of [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid).
Designed for GUI and 24-bit ('true-color') terminals, but will use 256-colors when those are not available.

A theme for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) is included as well.

This color scheme is also available for the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor. You can find it [here](https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/deep-space-syntax).

## Installation
There are a couple of ways to install this color scheme:
* Via a package manager (such as [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), etc.)
* Or, simply download this colorscheme to `~/.vim/colors/`

Then simply add `colorscheme deep-space` to your `.vimrc` file.

## TODO
- [ ] Provide 16 and 256-color support.
- [ ] Support for various plugins.
- [ ] Options for enabling/disabling italic and bold fonts.
- [ ] Better language support.
